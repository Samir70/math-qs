## How to use
The program uses a list of topics, called a worksheet, to create questions. There are several ways to interact with these. 

## Making a worksheet
Click on the "make a worksheet" button in the nav bar at the top. This takes you to a page with two lists.

The list on the right contains the topics that are currently in the worksheet (the notation is not very user friendly, but should make sense for now!). Click on an item in this list to remove it from the list.

The other column starts empty, but is populated when you search for an item. Type 'al' into the search bar and topics which use words starting with 'al' will be listed. eg: algebra

You don't need to use full words and you can search for two or more words, eg: 'fr ad' would get topics that include both fraction and add.

Click on an item in the list on the left to add them to the worksheet on the right.

## Using a worksheet
When you are done: click on 'view woksheet'

This takes you to the main page. I use this in class to display questions for revision. Students have a few minutes to work out the answers, then I can start revealing in which ever order I like. 

From this page: you can the change the questions, copy the questions to the clipboard (so you can make printed worksheets with different questions on the same topic) or view the questions as a quiz or take the bingo option.

## Bingo
This is a useful way to add a bit of competition to a worksheet. (Prizes not included!)

The questions are chosen from the topics in the current worksheet, missing out question types which don't have a short answer (eg: sorting). As questions are revealed, it is up to you whether or not to reveal the answer. You can go back to the answer selection page at any time (eg: if someone claims to have won) to see the answers to shown questions highlighted as a summary of answers already seen. 

 If you go through all the questions, then you are taken back to the answer list page. If you haven't been revealing the answers, then you can go through now. That tends to be less engaging to the students, but it is an option.

## Quiz
You can type in answers and have the computer mark them. There are also hints available.
